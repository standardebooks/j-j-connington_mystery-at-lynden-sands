						<a href="chapter-6.xhtml#illustration-1">A diagram of various sets of footmarks. At the bottom of the diagram is a road, labeled “To Lynden Sands” on the right. Centered at the top of the diagram is an oval shape labeled “Neptune’s Seat,” to which are connected five different sets of tracks. One set, labeled “Billingford,” arrives at Neptune’s Seat from the right, and then continues downwards towards the road. Two other sets lead from the road to Neptune’s Seat and then back again. One is labeled “Woman’s Light Shoes,” and the other is labeled “Woman’s Golf Shoes.” The latter set connects with the road at the same points as a set of motorcar tracks. A fourth set of footmarks, labeled “Murdered Man,” leads from the road to Neptune’s Seat but not back. Along the left edge of the diagram is a heavy line labeled “Groyne,” and a fifth set of tracks, labeled “Man’s Shoes,” comes from the road alongside the groyne and then back again.</a>

						<a href="chapter-12.xhtml#illustration-2">A diagram of three sets of footmarks. Two sets come from the left. One set, labeled “Fordingbridge,” stops in the middle of the diagram, near a large triangular shape labeled “Wreck.” The other set of tracks, labeled “<abbr>No.</abbr> 2,” parallels the first set but then continues off to the right. The third set, labeled “<abbr>No.</abbr> 3 Light Trail,” comes from the lower right to the end of the Fordingbridge tracks. They then turn back to the right, alongside <abbr>No.</abbr> 2, where they are labeled “<abbr>No.</abbr> 3 Heavy Trail.”</a>
